# Shell Scripting

## Feedback


## Request: posted videos
- videos are a lot of work for them to be high quality and accessible
- even just a basic zoom is one more thing to manage
- the notes have a *complete* transcript of every action on the terminal
- I will pilot using [webcaptioner](https://webcaptioner.com/) to produce a transcript of more detail. I will then use these to fill in the notes and/or post them on slack (in a dedicated channel)

### Request: more clear instructions
- Sorry, I'm adapting based on how far we get, so I don't have time to get iterative feedback on them.
- I will try to expand on them and add examples, also some patterns will emerge so you'll get used to the type of thing that's expected.
- also *always* feel free to ask more questions (slack or github issue to class repo)
- you *always* can revise your work, so it's also okay, espeically for more practice to put in the place of a response a question or try re-interpreting the instructions to check if they're correct.
- [recent updates commit](https://github.com/introcompsys/spring2022/commit/53c43e381f4752e589a562a998f46d11cc4cd001)

### Slack can be annoying
- check your notification settings!!
- use e-mail notifications if you prefer

### Installations are hard
- this is sort of generally true, sorry
- the download part makes them not good for in class
- always ask in slack
- we might be done with most for a while
- I will try to link to more detaled instructions if i can find them.


### Request: More direction for extensions
- instructions on site
- Will start to add notes with a marker

### Multiple repositories is hard to manage
- try to think of them as separate directories and have an offline copy of each.  We sort files often.
-  The reason for multiple is because that's actually somewhat more realistic, partially and partially becuase of how templates work

### This should be a 200 level course/ required
- the goal is for it to eventually be required and for most students to take it at the same time as 212. I'm glad (and other faculty will be too!) that you seem to agree


### Some things only work on mac

- I *think* everything essential can be done on any OS, but there are different ways.
- I try  to check everything and we are through the most tricky parts.
- If i miss something


### More lecture/slides would be helpful

- I probably shouldn't have offered "slides" I will use prismia so that I can stay adaptive and swap the order in response
- I will try to prepare diagrams for topics in advance and/or use the prismia drawing tool,
- *feel free to ask me to draw or explain* either by raising your hand or on prismia during class



## Jupyter Book

To make your KWL repo a jupyterbook, you need to:
- add the required files (`_toc.yml` and `_config.yml`)
- add your files to `_toc.yml`
- customize meta-data and settings in `_config.yml`


To add images, you add the file to the repository *and* mention it in a markdown file using the following syntax.

```Markdown
![mandatory alt text](relative/path/to/image)
```

also, [myst cheatsheet](https://jupyterbook.org/reference/cheatsheet.html#figures-and-images) from jupyterbook docs


## Bash has programming language features



[Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html) includes most common basic programming language features:
- conditional [expressions](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Conditional-Expressions.html) and [constructs](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Conditional-Constructs.html)
- [loops](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Looping-Constructs.html)
- variables and [builtin varialbes](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Shell-Variables)
- comments `#`


### Variables

```
echo $SHELL
```

```
/bin/bash
```

### Loops

The syntax for a loop is:

```
for name [ [in [words â€¦] ] ; ] do commands; done
```

or, with more spacing for readability

```bash
for item in [LIST]
do
  [COMMANDS]
done

```

Note in this syntax, we do not need a counter variable. In each iteration through the loop the next item from `[LIST]` becomes the value of `item`.

In our case, we can use this like:
```bash
for file in README.md gitoffline.md terminal.md software.md abstraction.md chart.md reorg.md stdinouterr.md hardwaresurvey.md gitlog.txt workflows.md gitplumbing.md gitunderstanding.md idethoughts.md numbers.md hexspeak.md gitstory.md gitstory2.md donotcommit.md jupyterbooktroubleshooting.md templating.md docs.md
> do
> echo $file
> done
```

To send all of the file names to STDOUT:
```
README.md
gitoffline.md
terminal.md
software.md
abstraction.md
chart.md
reorg.md
stdinouterr.md
hardwaresurvey.md
gitlog.txt
workflows.md
gitplumbing.md
gitunderstanding.md
idethoughts.md
numbers.md
hexspeak.md
gitstory.md
gitstory2.md
donotcommit.md
jupyterbooktroubleshooting.md
templating.md
docs.md
```

### Conditionals





```bash
for file in README.md gitoffline.md terminal.md software.md abstraction.md chart.md reorg.md stdinouterr.md hardwaresurvey.md gitlog.txt workflows.md gitplumbing.md gitunderstanding.md idethoughts.md numbers.md hexspeak.md gitstory.md gitstory2.md donotcommit.md jupyterbooktroubleshooting.md templating.md docs.md
> do
> if test -f $file; then
> echo $file
> fi
> done
```


## Shell Scripts


So, now we have checked your repository, but for you to use this on a regular basis there are two challenges.

1. You would have to type (or copy paste) those lines every time
1. the list of files will expand but the list in that will not update.  

We will address the first with a bash script.
Bash scripts allow you to make programs, including small utiltiies that help you with little tasks.
<!-- this is a good place to link a glossary entry -->


```
nano checker.sh
```


And we can paste this into the file:
```bash
for file in README.md gitoffline.md terminal.md software.md abstraction.md chart.md reorg.md stdinouterr.md hardwaresurvey.md gitlog.txt workflows.md gitplumbing.md gitunderstanding.md idethoughts.md numbers.md hexspeak.md gitstory.md gitstory2.md donotcommit.md jupyterbooktroubleshooting.md templating.md docs.md
> do
> if ! test -f $file; then
> echo $file
> fi
> done
```

## Installing from source


We have used programs that we installed from their installation tools. Today we will use a small program I wrote for class, that we install from source.

```
git clone https://github.com/introcompsys/courseutils
```

```
Cloning into 'courseutils'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 16, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (16/16), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (13/13), done.
remote: Total 16 (delta 5), reused 6 (delta 2), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (16/16), 4.03 KiB | 4.03 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (5/5), done.
```

First we can look at what this contains.
```
cd courseutils/
ls
```
It is very lightweight:

```
LICENSE		README.md	kwltracking.py	setup.py
```

Let's review the purpose of each
- This repo is public, so it has a license to describe how it is pertmitted to be used
- The README is information about the repository; currently it has the documentation
- kwltracking.py is the actual code of the program
- setup.py is instructions for python's `pip` on how to install the program.



```
pip install .
```



````{margin}
```{note}
This output is truncated
```
````
If it works, there will be along output that ends like:
```
...
Successfully installed syscourseutils-0.1.0
```

After you install, you will need to open a new terminal window (or otherwise restart bash, which varies on a lot of parameters)

Making it *installable* changes how we can run and use the program. In particular, it makes it a bash command.

So, on the terminal, we can use it like:
```
kwlfilecheck
```

This program scrapes the course website and echos to stdout the list of files expected in the KWL chart repo.
```
README gitoffline.md terminal.md software.md abstraction.md chart.md reorg.md stdinouterr.md hardwaresurvey.md gitlog.txt workflows.md gitplumbing.md gitunderstanding.md idethoughts.md numbers.md hexspeak.md gitstory.md gitstory2.md donotcommit.md jupyterbooktroubleshooting.md templating.md docs.md
```

Now, back in your KWL repo, we want to change our script to use this.
```
cd ..
```

We can edit the script, with nano
```
nano checker.sh
```

We can edit it so that it calls that process, assigns its output to a variable, and then uses that variable as our list output like this:

```
for file in $(kwlfilechecker)
do
 if ! test -f $file; then
  echo $file
 fi
done
```

Now you can use:
```
bash checker.sh
```

To see what, if any files you are missing.

## Extension Ideas

1. document or add course scripts to the courseutils repo
1. write a similar util for another context and document it
1. turn your bash script above (if not the toy counting one) into a longer tutorial that explains its components piece by piece, how they work together.
1. use the jupyter book [api referencing capability](https://jupyterbook.org/advanced/developers.html?highlight=api) to document a side project or code from a different course, eg 110 (keep it in a separate private repo so as to not put solutions to a course on the public internet)


## Questions after class

### Will we create bash programs from scratch?
```{toggle}
At least small ones, we probably will not write large programs though.
```

### What are some applications of bash scripting?
```{toggle}
We will see its use in HPC in the next class, but also for small utilities like this.
```
