## Prelude: REPL

One way we can use an interpreted language like python is to treat the interpreter like an application and then interact with it in the terminal.

## Questions After Class


Class Response Summary:



### When is the cutoff for getting work approved for the class?
```{toggle}
Our assigned final exam time is: DATE

So, until then you can get feedback and revise.  At that time, my assessment of your work will be final, and I'll evaluate your contract.
```

### Will the fact that we didn't have class the other week effect the amount of work we have to complete for our contracts?
```{toggle}
I will announce by how many you can reduce the required number of more practice/deeper exploration you can do.
```


• what are some programing implementations of this arithmetic

• Is there a low-level interface to actually make using bits as flags useful in python?

• whats the likely hood of me using bit operations in high level languages

• When would we use those binary operation (like in a job / research)?

### When using the bitwise operators (the &, |, etc.) what are the inputs?
```{toggle}
In Python, bit level operators are defined only for integers
```

• how often (if ever) do you find yourself working in a python shell like we did today? I find that to be extremely annoying and would rather take the time to make a .py file and use an IDE/run it from the terminal


### Questions to be answered later

- I have seen XOR gate used to solve certain programming problems efficiently, but I am curious about how to actually implement it
