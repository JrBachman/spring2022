    "Since you can't delete a directory with files in it you need to recursively delete the folder and its contents. The ```-R``` is a recursive declaration which tells the terminal to delete the folder, the files within the folder, subfolders, files in the subfolder etc. [Source](https://www.macworld.com/article/222596/command-line-deleting-files-folders-mac-terminal.html)\n",

    "```\n",
    "If we were to run `ls *.py` while in the `stuff/` directory, the command actually run by the computer is `ls a.py b.py c.py`. This also works for commands like `mv`. I.e. `mv *.py nested_folder/` runs `mv a.py b.py c.py nested_folder/`"
