# Advice to future students

```{epigraph}
Don't fall behind on the work, even though all of the work is self-paced you do not want to be doing it all last minute. 
Also, make sure you re-read the notes after class to get a firmer grasp on what was taught and make sure to always do the 
`prepare for next class` work so that you won't fall behind in class and you can follow along.

To get the most out of CSC 392, students should come to class where there are in class activites to practice the content learned. Going over the notes is also a great
way to refresh students with the subjects. Although students are given the ability to do work on their own time with the only due date being the end of the semester, I
would advise everyone to start on their work at their soonest convenience. I did not always start on work the same week due to other work and outside responsibilities
but working on this course work early was always better than doing it later. When you start early you are able to dive deeper into the course contents and have a better
learning experience.

Keep up! There's a lot of interesting and useful work to be done in this class
but don't let the ability to turn things in at your own pace let you get behind.
Additionally, if you're going for an "A Creative" grade, map out your projects
in advance and have a good plan for their execution. This class can really trip
you up because it will cover concepts you might already know the basics of and
go just that one step deeper.
